About the assignment

We would like to present you our take-home assignment. This should take you between 2-6 hours to complete depending on how much work you put into it. Please use this as a chance to show off your skills as a developer.

We would like you to create a movie discovering web app using the The Movie Database API.

Requirements

1. When loaded we should see a list of the popular movies and a search bar.
2. If we search from a movie in the search bar we should see a list of the movies whose title matches my search.
3. If we click on a movie it should take use to a page where we see more information about that movie.
4. Testing.
5. Use Git to log your work, if you take any breaks comment them.

You may use any programming language and/or framework. But it would be preferable to use React, because it is in our front end stack.

Extra Points (optional)

1. You incorporate other aspects of the movie API to make the application richer.
2. The UI/UX is nice.
3. Good testing.

Please send us a zip of the source code (or a link to a github repo) with instructions on how to boot and run the application.

Please, meet our Frontend Lead, Tomas Madariaga. He'll be your go-to person for questions regarding the assignment and also the one who will review it with the rest of our team.

Would you be able to send it by Wednesday, 23rd? Let us know if you need more time.

We look forward to seeing what you come up with! and please, confirm you've received this email.
